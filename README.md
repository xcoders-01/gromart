## Performance Considerations

-   **Caching:** Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., page caching, fragment caching) to reduce database load and improve response times.
-   **Database Optimization:** Optimize database queries and indexes to ensure efficient data retrieval.
-   **Code Optimization:** Profile your code and identify performance bottlenecks. Refactor code for better performance.
-   **Image Optimization:** Optimize images for web delivery by compressing them and using appropriate formats.
-   **CDN:** Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve static assets (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) from geographically distributed servers.

## Security Notes

-   **Input Validation:** Always validate user input to prevent SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other security vulnerabilities.
-   **Output Escaping:** Escape output to prevent XSS attacks.
-   **CSRF Protection:** Enable CSRF protection to prevent cross-site request forgery attacks.
-   **Password Hashing:** Use strong password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) to protect user passwords.
-   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
-   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Stay up-to-date with the latest security patches for CodeIgniter 4 and its dependencies.
-   **.env Security:** Ensure your `.env` file is not accessible from the web.
